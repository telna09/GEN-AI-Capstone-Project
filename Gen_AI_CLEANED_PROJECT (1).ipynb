      "The student correctly identified hypertension as the diagnosis, but failed to specify the stage. The student's reasoning was brief and lacked evidence-based logic, relying on the patient's high blood pressure and stress levels. To improve, the student should focus on gathering more information through targeted questions, considering multiple differential diagnoses, and following a systematic approach to diagnostic reasoning. For example, the student could have asked about the patient's lifestyle, family history, or previous blood pressure readings to support their diagnosis.\n",
